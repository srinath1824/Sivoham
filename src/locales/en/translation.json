      "aboutParagraph1": "Parama Pujya Sree Jeeveswara Yogi was born with Awakened Kundalini. In his childhood, when he went to Srisailam for Siva darsan, he unknowingly meets his Guru for the first time which changes his life forever. He once went into deep Samadhi in his school during meditation class. He practiced intense sadhana before attaining self-realization in early stages of his life. When he wanted to undergo Jeeva Samadhi at a very young age, his Guru directed him to teach this divine sadhana to humanity. Then, he renounced his blooming professional career and decided to dedicate his life to teach Siva Kundalini Sadhana to all.",
      "aboutParagraph2": "He kept immense efforts on simplifying and optimizing the sadhana methodology to make it easier and more effective for common people to learn and practice. Leading a very humble family life, he is teaching Siva Kundalini Sadhana to thousands of people. He organized the course content in such a way that anyone, whether he is new to meditation or has many years of practice, can take the course and get utmost benefits at each level of the course.",
      "whyHeading": "Why Siva Kundalini Sadhana",
      "whyParagraph1": "There are many yogic practices in India which can help a person attain self-realization. However, there are quite a few of them which can be practiced by everyone in all walks of life and without any restrictions. Siva Kundalini Sadhana is a Unique course which lets the sadhak experience higher states like Samadhi in a very short time which otherwise takes several years of sadhana. Using this sadhana one can awaken their Kundalini Energy and activate the Chakras.",
      "whyParagraph2": "Entering into Sushumna nadi is one of the most difficult achievements for a sadhak. Many yogis spend many years in intense sadhana to get to this state. In Siva Kundalini Sadhana, with the grace of Parama Pujya Sree Jeeveswara Yogi, one can not just enter into Sushumna nadi instantly but can also be in that state throughout the day.",
      "whyParagraph3": "Sadhaks can solve all their problems as most of them are related to any one of the 7 Chakras. Siva Kundalini Sadhana is a path that can take you from connecting with the creator to transforming yourselves into the creator. This Divine Knowledge and experience is of immense value which cannot be paid. Hence it is offered Free of cost.",

          "text": "I spent many years in Himalayas and travelled across India in pursuit of Moksha. I met many Siddha Gurus and realized that even though they have so many powers they themselves are not liberated. Only a self-experienced person can guide others to the path of liberation. When I heard of Guru Sree Jeeveswara Yogi I immediately rushed down to meet him. I experienced him as one of the rarest Advaitha Shaktipath Guru and we cannot find one like him anywhere else in this era. He is abundantly capable, willing to impart his powers and is also making others attain higher spiritual states like Samadhi. I strongly believe that he can take me to the path of my liberation. This is a true miracle on earth, I feel so blessed and fortunate to have found him and I have decided to dedicate my life to him."

We might have made great Punya in our past lives which lead us to learn such a wonderful sadhana today. To describe his greatness it is as difficult as trying to hold an ocean in a small vessel. He is Shiva himself. He is always working hard to transform us into enlightened beings, into Shiva. He experiments with the techniques on himself first before he teaches us to make sure what he teaches is working nothing less than 100% and is safe."

          "text": "I have read a lot of books on Kundalini and many Upanishads. However, there is only a mention of how to do and what to do in them. There is no one to teach the same to you practically. Sree Jeeveswara Yogi is imparting that practical knowledge whole heartedly without expecting anything from us. Gurujiï¿½s intention is that everyone should get the knowledge from him and become like him. Only Shiva can do like that. To transform us like Shiva, Shiva himself sent Guruji. I learnt how to take the energy, pass it and how to be in Samadhi states. I keep practicing the sadhana so that I can be in Samadhi state always."

          "text": "When I attended Level 1 class, in the first instance I felt I came to a realized Guru. After that my life has transformed. In Level 3 there is a technique called Bhuta shuddhi, I tried to test how it works with some electronic instruments. After I did the process taught by Guruji my swadhistana chakra got balanced 100% which was only 30% before. When our experience is backed with scientific proof it becomes authentic and genuine. Once I tasted Samadhi state I want to be in that state all through the day in all activities I do. Guruji can give any amount of energy but how much we can receive depends only on us. He is accessible and he can guide us. In just 4 months of my journey I could experience Samadhi state."

I am able to sit in meditation for around 5-6 hours sometimes and go into Samadhi states. There is a profound transformation in me and I feel a lot of bliss inside and became calmer. I cannot thank enough our Guru for blessing me with such a wonderful and divine experience. He always makes sure every sadhak is practicing the techniques properly and takes their feedback constantly."
